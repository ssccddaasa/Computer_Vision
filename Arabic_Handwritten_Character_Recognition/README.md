# Arabic Handwritten Character Recognition (AHCR) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Background
Handwriting recognition is a challenging computer vision problem involving the identification and transformation of handwritten text into a machine-understandable format. Arabic handwriting poses unique challenges due to its semi-cursive nature and right-to-left writing style. Various machine learning methods, including CNNs, have been explored for this task.

## Objectives
This assignment aims to introduce students to AHCR using CNNs. Objectives include building a basic CNN for AHCR, exploring advanced techniques like data augmentation and pre-trained models, and comparing different architectures' performance.

## Tasks
1. **Build and Train Custom CNN**: Students build and train a custom CNN for AHCR, experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters.
2. **Retrain with Data Augmentation**: The selected model from Task 1 is retrained using data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
3. **Select Established CNN Architecture**: Students choose a well-known CNN architecture (e.g., ResNet50) and train it for AHCR, comparing its performance with Task 1 and Task 2.
4. **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained CNN models are fine-tuned for AHCR using transfer learning, with results compared to previous tasks.

## Dataset
The assignment utilizes the provided dataset for training and testing the models.
